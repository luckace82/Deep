# Deep
Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. 



# Neural network
A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain.


# Types of neural networks
1. ANN(artificial neural network)
   .multilayer perceptron
2. CNN
3. RNN
   ...LSTM()lng short term memory
4. Auto encoodersG
5. Generative Adverserial Networks

# History of Deep learning
   -in the sixties
   -1969 the first ai winter--perceptron cant learn xor function
   -1980 the rise
   -ninties the second AI winter
   
# Applications of Deep learning
   - self driving cars
   - games
   - application (chatbots)
   - image colorizations
   - adding audioo to mute videos
   - image caption generation
   - translator
   - pixel  restoration
   - object detection
   - GAN
   - handwriting generator
   - deep dreaming
   - research in medical field

# Perceptron
  fundamental building block of deep learning

  -- it is an algorithm ,used for supervised machine learning

  # design
    mathmatical model(function)
  # training a perceptron
   data needed
