# Deep
Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. 



# Neural network



# Types of neural networks
1. ANN(artificial neural network)
   .multilayer perceptron
2. CNN
3. RNN
   ...LSTM()lng short term memory
4. Auto encoodersG
5. Generative Adverserial Networks

# History of Deep learning
   -in the sixties
   -1969 the first ai winter--perceptron cant learn xor function
   -1980 the rise
   -ninties the second AI winter
   
# Applications of Deep learning
   -self driving cars
